            <p class="blogentry" > Hello Everyone! My name is Robert Niggebrugge and I am a Senior at the College of Charleston in the B.S. in Computer Science program. Today I am posting to tell you all a bit about me and what to expect from this blog. Some interests of mine are cooking, biking, doing extracurricular work on CIRDLES, and video games. The main reason for this blog is to record progress as I continue my progress in the class CSCI 362: Software Engineering, but I will also be using as a place to other interesting things I find or learn as the semester progresses. Simple and to the point is what you can expect from me and my posts. All the best and stay safe!</p>
