            <p class="blogentry" > Best Team is currently wrapping up project work and creating our final reports. We concluded our mutation testing exercise earlier this week with great results. Many mutants were killed. This came after significant reworks to our automated testing framework. The main changes worked on were modifying the handling of cases from a single batch of tests to be executed into a sequential queue. The purpose of this was to enable scalability of the testing framework. Currently it is able to process the desired amount of 25 test cases. With the previous design, we ran into execution issues with larger amounts of test cases. The redesigned code is now able to handle larger amounts due to executing sequentially in order to avoid running into possible memory issues. We additionally found a quick and convient way for users of the testing framework to set up and configure it with a single script directly after cloning the repository. There have been many additional tweaks and redesigns to enable ease of use and readability for potential users. The implementation of this project has greatly helped our group understand and appreciate better methods of code design and user interaction. All in all, Best Team has learned a lot and gained a great appreciation for the critical importance of testing in software development.
