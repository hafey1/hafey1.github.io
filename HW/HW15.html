            <p class="blogentry" > 19.3)  Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?
            </p>    
            
            <li>It is impossible becausee the sum of the components is greater than it's parts. A complex system is not only comprised of the components it also takes into account the interactions and relationships between the components. This new complex system has far more actions and reactions than all of its components unconnected. Many of these new interactions and relationships are unknown because they have not been encountered. Engineers could have a good idea of some of the possible issues that could arise but the complexity of a system is often far too great to be fully known before actually connecting the pieces together.
