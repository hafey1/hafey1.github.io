            <h1 class="blogentry">HW10: Ex 15.10</h1>
            <p class="blogentry" > 15.10) The reuse of software raises a number
                of copyright and intellectual property issues. If a customer
                pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the 
                right to reuse the developed code? Does the software 
                contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a
                generic component? What payment mechanisms might be used to 
                reimburse providers of reusable components? Discuss these 
                issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software.
                
                <li>Ownership of software and code is a tricky issue that has resulted
                    in many legal battles. Although people lay on many different 
                    sides of the issue, I believe I have a strong case for defining
                    where and how ownership of code should be split up.
                </li>
                <li>If a customer pays for a system to be developed by a software contractor
                    it seems very clear to me that the customer is not paying for the code.
                    They pay for the product that is the result of the code. If a software
                    contractor uses a unique version of a binary search as a tool for a part
                    of a system, how could the client possibly claim ownership? It seems
                    obvious to me that they can not. This is because the source code is a 
                    compilation of tools created by the contractor. Would we say that a 
                    homeowner owns the tools that a carpenter used to create their house?
                    A contractor would 100% have the right to use that code as a basis
                    for generic components as long as what they are claiming ownership of
                    is not the sum result of the code or does not closely mimic the system.
                    Even in cases where they do claim ownership of a large part of the code
                    that the client paid for there is still a threshold of how generic the
                    system is. If a client paid for a website to be built, it seems perfectly
                    reasonable to me that the software contractor could reuse an extremely large
                    portion of the codebase for a new client because although the code could be 99%
                    the same, the product being bought is different.
                </li>
                
                 <li>As for payment mechanisms for providers of these reusable components there are
                    many examples. The best one in my opinion are website template sites such as
                    squarespace or wix. Subscription or one time payment for use of generic components
                    take place on both of these sites. The key here is however that they do not own nor
                    sell the tools to make their products. They do not own the nitty gritty bits of source code.
                    That source code could be used by developers to create generic components
                    for their own use in future projects.</li>
